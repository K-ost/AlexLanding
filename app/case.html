					<h2 id="chapter3">Implemented Components</h2>
					<p>To enable advanced reporting, our developers used the Webix Report Manager widget. It allows users to create and configure reports of any complexity, set various data sources and combine them, create and save filter queries, group, filter, and sort data by different criteria. Data can be visualized as configurable diagrams or heatmaps. Reports can be exported into various formats, including CSV, Excel, and PDF. Among other advantages provided by Report Manager, we can mention:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Easy access via the web browser;</li>
						<li>Efficient work with large and complex datasets;</li>
						<li>An extensive set of data operations, including counting, comparing, and giving the average values.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Webix Document Manager was used to ensure comfortable work with cloud file storage. Its broad customization abilities allowed the development team to use it in two ways. First, as a separate widget for working with files. Second, as a separate block on the document page for attaching files to it. This widget allows searching files, viewing, editing, and adding tags, which helps organize files and folders. Users can comment on files and share them with their colleagues to improve teamwork. Additionally, Document Manager allows to:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Switch between old and new layouts;</li>
						<li>Make quick on-the-fly changes in files;</li>
						<li>Play audio and video files;</li>
						<li>Use the preview panel for quick navigation.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>To help admins efficiently manage user roles, developers used the Webix User Manager widget. It allows quickly adding new users with specific access rights and permissions or adjusting them for existing users. Provided functionality also includes:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Tracking all user actions and built-in security audit;</li>
						<li>Analyzing and summarizing user information;</li>
						<li>Automated identification and authorization.</li>
					</ul>
